# Elegant Emacs: Expanded

The lovely [elegant emacs](https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs/) but with my own opinionated additions to it.

## To-do
Currently on the chopping block:

- Expanding and testing out the Org Mode GTD workflow
- Establishing and using the Org Mode project management config.
- Figuring out how to integrate some of [Rougier](https://github.com/rougier)'s other Emacs hacks.
- Integrating LSP, company, and IDE-like features while still retaining minimalism.
- More config centered around coding
